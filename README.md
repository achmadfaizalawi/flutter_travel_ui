# Flutter Travel UI

This is the **development/v1** branch, developments that have been carried out include:
1. Create a home page. Contains user name, list of popular travel places, travel place categories, and bottom navigation bar.
2. Create a travel location detail page. Contains location photos, description, gallery photo list, further menu options, travel prices, and a button to order tickets.

## Reference

In the UI slicing process I took design references from the [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/18038495-Travel-App) platform.
