# Flutter Travel UI

Travel applications are applications that users use to prepare their travel activities, such as viewing recommendations for travel locations and purchasing tickets. This travel application was created to study the process of slicing UI from images into applications developed with Flutter. There is a reference design that I use for the slicing process.

## Key feature

1. View a list of popular places to travel.
2. View the travel location description and gallery.

## Installation

1. Clone this project:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/achmadfaizalawi/flutter_travel_ui.git

2. Open the project in a Flutter IDE, such as Visual Studio Code or Android Studio.

3. Run the application on an emulator or physical device using the command:
   ```bash
   flutter run

## Branch

In the application development process, the results of application development are saved outside the main branch. The following are the available branches:
- **main**: The first branch in application development.
- **development/v1**: Development of home page and details place page.
