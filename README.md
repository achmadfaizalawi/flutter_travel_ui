# Flutter Travel UI

This is the **development/v1** branch, developments that have been carried out include:
1. Create a home page. Contains user name, list of popular travel places, travel place categories, and bottom navigation bar.
2. Create a travel location detail page. Contains location photos, description, gallery photo list, further menu options, travel prices, and a button to order tickets.

## Usage

1. To see details of a travel location, you can press the travel location image on the home page.
2. To move to another page, you can press the selection button at the bottom navigation bar. However, currently the only page that is ready is the homepage. Other pages are still under development.

## Reference

In the UI slicing process I took design references from the [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/18038495-Travel-App) platform.
